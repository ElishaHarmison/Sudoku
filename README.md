<strong>Sudoku</strong>

  Sudoku is a mathematical based game. It requires the user inputting numbers within empty boxes; ensuring each box, row and column correspond.
 
<strong>Instructions</strong>

  In order to play Sudoku you need to understand the basics of what the game requires.
  You must place the numbers 1-9 within each box. However, the boxes directly adjacent must not contain numbers in the same rows or columns as the others.
  An example of how the boxes should look is given below(The lines seperate two boxes):
  
  <table>
  <tr>
   <td>
    1 2 3
   </td>
   <td>
     4 5 6
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
     4 5 6 
   </td>
   <td>
      7 8 9
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
      7 8 9 
   </td>
   <td>
     1 2 3
   </td>
  </tr>
 </table>
  
  As you can see, the numbers on the left go from 1-9 without any of the numbers being the same; this is also found on the right hand side, so both columns are correct.
  
  This also works if you go across the rows, each number is present but is not found more than once on that row.
  
  This is how Sudoku works, you need to be able to place numbers within the empty boxes, without finding the same number within the adjacent row or column.
 

<strong>Purpose of the game</strong>

<strong>Features</strong>

This game of Sudoku contains different features in order for it to perform high functionality and providing the user with aspects that make it as realistic to the paper based puzzle as possible. This puzzle contains two main pages, the introduction page and the game itself.

The introduction page contains instructions on how the game is to be played, allowing users who have not previously played Sudoku to understand the basics of this game is played. Once the user has read and understood the rules they then enter the game by selecting the start button.

The game page itself provides the user with the 9 x 9 Sudoku grid. Once they have access to the game they are required to fill in the empty boxes with numbers 1-9. Once they have complete all of the boxes the user can then press submit to check their answers. The programme then checks the users input to the saved solution to see if they have chosen the correct input.
The user is provided with an alert that tells them if they have won or not once they have filled in all the boxes and clicked submit. 

After the submit button has provided the user with their win/lose alert a sound plays, that corresponds with the message presented to the user. If the player doesn't complete the Sudoku correctly they will be told something is incorrect, which prompts them to try again until they find their error - then presenting the win alert.
