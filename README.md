<strong>Sudoku</strong>

  Sudoku is a mathematical based game. It requires the user inputting numbers within empty boxes; ensuring each box, row and column correspond.
 
<strong>Instructions</strong>

  In order to play Sudoku you need to understand the basics of what the game requires.
  You must place the numbers 1-9 within each box. However, the boxes directly adjacent must not contain numbers in the same rows or columns as the others.
  An example of how the boxes should look is given below(The lines seperate two boxes):
  
  <table>
  <tr>
   <td>
    1 2 3
   </td>
   <td>
     4 5 6
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
     4 5 6 
   </td>
   <td>
      7 8 9
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
      7 8 9 
   </td>
   <td>
     1 2 3
   </td>
  </tr>
 </table>
  
  As you can see, the numbers on the left go from 1-9 without any of the numbers being the same; this is also found on the right hand side, so both columns are correct.
  
  This also works if you go across the rows, each number is present but is not found more than once on that row.
  
  This is how Sudoku works, you need to be able to place numbers within the empty boxes, without finding the same number within the adjacent row or column.
 

<strong>Purpose of the game</strong>
